# Welcome to LadderWarp repo!

LadderWarp is a small KSP mod that lets you use timewarp with EVA kerbals on ladders. As of now it only adds LadderSeat module to the stock's Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer. This module is a slightly modified KerbalSeat module. The difference is that it provides no control and boarding radius is really small (you should grab the ladder you are going to board to get within the radius). The mod also contains a small KSPAddon that lets you use seated kerbal's buttons with no control (otherwise you could board a ladder of an uncontrolled vessel and have no "Leave Seat" button).

## A bit of warning

I don't really understand how do the config numbers for ejectionDirection and ejectionForceDirection work. When you leave the ladder's seat your kerbal is spawned not exactly at the ladder he/she occupied. Make sure you use these virtual seats only on ladders with some free space around. It is possible that you won't be able to grab a ladder after detaching, please take some EVA fuel. And the last thing. Use ejection force slider **at your risk**.

## A bit of asking for help

If you know how to make detaching and ejection more reliable, share the config please :)
